# My AKS Cluster

This repository contains my personal Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster configuration and deployment infrastructure. It serves as a comprehensive example of deploying and managing AKS clusters using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Bicep.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- **AKS Cluster Deployment**: Automated deployment of Azure Kubernetes Service clusters
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Using Terraform modules for reproducible infrastructure
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Integration with Azure Monitor, Grafana, and Prometheus
- **Container Registry**: Azure Container Registry (ACR) integration
- **Sample Applications**: Demo applications showcasing AKS capabilities including Dapr integration
- **Security & Compliance**: Azure Policy integration and security best practices

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`aks-automatic-deployment/`** - Terraform configuration for AKS Automatic cluster deployment
- **`cluster-deployment/`** - Standard AKS cluster deployment configurations
- **`github-deployment/`** - GitHub Actions and CI/CD related configurations
- **`modules/`** - Reusable Terraform modules for various Azure resources
- **`apps/`** - Sample applications and Kubernetes manifests
  - **`radius-dapr-demo/`** - Demo application showcasing Dapr and Radius integration
  - **`aks-azure-policy/`** - Azure Policy examples and configurations

## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed as a learning resource and reference implementation. Each directory contains its own documentation and configuration files that you can study and adapt for your own use cases.

### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI
- Terraform
- kubectl
- Docker (for containerized applications)

### Usage

1. Fork this repository to your own account
2. Customize the configurations in the `tfvars/` directories
3. Run Terraform to deploy your own version of the infrastructure
4. Explore the sample applications and modify them as needed
